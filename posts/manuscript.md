# Early Modern Manuscripts: Transcription, Encoding and Digitalization

As part of the MA colloquium “From the Archives to Digital Database: Encoding Early Modern Manuscript Texts” taught by Dr. Beatrice Montedoro at the University of Zurich in 2021, I transcribed early modern manuscripts and encoded them in HTML (original and standardized version). The results were then published on the digital database [DEx](https://dex.digitalearlymodern.com/).

My contribution spans extracts with the following page numbers under [Bodleian Library MS English poetry d. 3](https://daikatana.digitalearlymodern.com/manuscripts/?query=BodleianMSEngpoetd3.xml):
<ul>
 <li>f. 42r, f. 42v</li>
 <li>f. 80r, f. 80v</li>
 <li>f. 81r, f. 81v</li>
 <li>f. 86v</li>
</ul>

Further additions of mine (as part of an XML collectively transcribed by all participants in the seminar) can be found [here](https://daikatana.digitalearlymodern.com/manuscripts/?query=BodleianMSEngmiscd28.xml&spelling=normalized):
<ul>

<li>By Crequi, in The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Byron (4.1.176-185), George Chapman in Bodleian Library MS English miscellaneous d. 28, col. 701</li>
