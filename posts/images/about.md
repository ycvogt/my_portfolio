Hi, my name is Evie.

I am a linguist with 2+ years of experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP), continuously working on expanding my skills further. I program mainly in _Python_ and _R_. At university, my studies focused on Language Data Processing, Machine Learning, Text Mining and Corpus Linguistics. My current interests lie in Data Analysis.
