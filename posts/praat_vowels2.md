##  Part I: Hypothesis Testing, Significance Testing - Frequency Alterations as Voice Disguise Strategy

In the following project* I explored inhowfar people change their fundamental frequency (F0, informally known as pitch) to disguise their voice. The participants (n=11) were prompted to read a text consisting of twelve sentences once in a ’normal’ voice and once in a ’disguised voice’ that should render them unrecognizable, even for people who know them well. They were not given any input as to what the strategy might entail to avoid any interference with their ad hoc solution to disguise their voice. My research question was thus: Inhowfar do the participants employ alteration in fundamental frequency (F0)?
The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are therefore:
* H0: There is no statistically significant difference between normal and disguised average fundamental frequencies among participants in continuous speech based on acoustic.
* H1: There is a statistically significant difference between normal and disguised average fundamental frequencies among participants in continuous speech based on acoustic.

The data was measured in _Praat_, by selecting the entire sentence of a participant and measuring the average F0 for the selected segment. This was repeated for all sentences of each participant, once for the regular and once for the disguised voice dataset.
