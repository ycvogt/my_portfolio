Hi, my name is Yvonne.

I am a linguist with 3+ years of experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP), continuously challenging myself and expanding my skill set further. I program mainly in _Python_ and _R_. At university, my studies focused on Language Data Processing, Machine Learning, Text Mining and Corpus Linguistics. Apart from this, I am familiar with quantitative and qualitative analyses of textual data, linguistic analysis software (especially _Praat_) and the transcription/encoding of manuscripts. My current interests lie in Digital Humanities, Linguistics and Text Data Analysis.
